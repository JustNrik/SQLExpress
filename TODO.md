#Possible implementation of Lists/Arrays/Etc...

Currently, I will only plan to support:

T[] // All kind of matrixes hopefully, initial support will be probably upto [][][]

List(Of T)

ValueTuple(Of T1, T2, ..., T7) // I will also support TRest As Structure later

Dictionary(Of TKey, TValue)

And all variants of IEnumerable(Of T)
